# Scala Play Skills Tracker

A reference project to build a Scala Play API app and deploy to Heroku

An app to track users, and their skills

API base URL [here](https://scala-play-skills-tracker.herokuapp.com)

## Run/Build Locally

- In project root directory, run `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL database
- Then, run the following commands:

```bash
sbt # start the sbt shell
run # run the app!
```

- When running the app for the first time, you may need to visit `http://localhost:9000` to run a Flyway migration

## Usage

- Make a `POST` request with the following body to `http://localhost:9000/login` to authenticate user and obtain the `auth_token`:

```bash
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password"
}
```

- Make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:9000/profiles` with header `Authorization` with the `auth_token` value to list user profiles 

- See the full Postman collection [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c32b2d46e762f9df7ad4)
- Currently, only the `GET`, and `DELETE` methods of the `/profiles` end-points require user authentication

## Deploy to Heroku

- In project root directory, run the following commands. See reference documentations [here](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ProductionHeroku)

```bash
heroku create # create heroku app
git push heroku master # deploy to Heroku
heroku ps # check app status
heroku logs # view logs
```

- Then, visit the Heroku Postgres database page [here](https://data.heroku.com/), and find the database username, and password
- Create two Heroku environment variables for `HEROKU_DATABASE_USERNAME`, and `HEROKU_DATABASE_PASSWORD` See reference documentations [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)
- Update `play.filters.hosts` in `application.conf` with the Heorku app URL
- Deploy to Heroku again
